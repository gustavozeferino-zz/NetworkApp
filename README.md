## READ ME for Shiny Network Application

This Shiny application visualizes a graph structure for a dataset. The user can adjust all features of the visualized graph and download a pdf version of it. Furthermore, centrality analyses will automatically be performed; a centrality table and plot will be visualized in the second and third tab and both can be downloaded. The fourth and fifth tab visualizes the Clustering table and plot; these can also be downloaded. Code for running the application can be found in the runapp.R file.

This application is a project that is under construction, features will be added along the way. If you have any suggestions as to what features are useful to be added, please feel free to contact me at mail[at]jolandakossakowski[dot]eu.

Version 0.2 of this application has now been released. Visit https://jolandakos.shinyapps.io/NetworkApp/ to try it out!
